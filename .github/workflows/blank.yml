name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed
    branches: [ "main" ]
    paths:
      - 'src/main/**'

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
